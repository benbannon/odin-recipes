<h3>A Delicious Bowl of Fried Rice</h3>

<p1>Use fresh or leftover white rice for this easy, vegetable-studded fried rice recipe. We fry the grains in batches and season the dish lightly for a perfect texture and flavor.</p1>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into small dice</li>
    <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) soy sauce</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) toasted sesame oil</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and ground white pepper</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>4 ounces (115g) frozen peas</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>If using day-old rice (see note), transfer to a medium bowl and break the rice up with your hands into individual grains before proceeding. Heat 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) vegetable oil in a wok over high heat until smoking. Add half of rice and cook, stirring and tossing, until the rice is pale brown and toasted and has a lightly chewy texture, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with another 1/2 tablespoon oil and remaining rice.</li>
    <li>Return all the rice to the wok and press it up the sides, leaving a space in the middle. Add 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil to the space. Add onion, carrot, scallions, and garlic and cook, stirring gently, until lightly softened and fragrant, about 1 minute. Toss with rice to combine. Add soy sauce and sesame oil and toss to coat. Season to taste with salt and white pepper.</li>
    <li>Push rice to the side of the wok and add remaining 1/2 tablespoon (7ml) oil. Break the egg into the oil and season with a little salt. Use a spatula to scramble the egg, breaking it up into small bits. Toss the egg and the rice together.</li>
    <li>Add frozen peas and continue to toss and stir until peas are thawed and every grain of rice is separate. Serve immediately.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
