<h3>A Scrumptious Bowl Of Caeser Salad</h3>

<p1>Classic Caesar Salad with crisp homemade croutons and a light caesar dressing – for when you want to impress your dinner guests.</p1>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup (105ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)</li>
    <li>3 cups hearty bread, cut into 3/4-inch cubes</li>
    <li>2 ounces finely grated Parmesan cheese (about 1 cup), divided</li>
    <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) juice from 1 lemon</li>
    <li>2 to 6 anchovies</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1/3 cup (80ml) canola oil</li>
    <li>2 heads romaine lettuce</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). In a small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil with minced garlic and whisk for 30 seconds. Transfer to a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl and press with the back of a spoon to extract as much oil as possible, leaving garlic behind. Reserve pressed garlic separately. Add bread cubes to garlic oil and toss to coat.</li>
    <li>Add 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, toss again, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until croutons are pale golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and toss with 2 more tablespoons Parmesan. Allow to cool.</li>
    <li>While croutons bake, make the dressing. Combine egg yolk, lemon juice, anchovies, Worcestershire sauce, pressed garlic, and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese in the bottom of a cup that just fits the head of an immersion blender or in the bottom of a food processor. With blender or processor running, slowly drizzle in canola oil until a smooth emulsion forms. Transfer mixture to a medium bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in remaining 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil. Season to taste generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>To serve, toss lettuce with a few tablespoons of dressing, adding more if desired. Once lettuce is coated, add half of remaining cheese and three-quarters of croutons and toss again. Transfer to a salad bowl and sprinkle with remaining cheese and croutons. Serve.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
